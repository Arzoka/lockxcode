# lockxcode

Test to see if I can combine html, css, javascript code all in one file for direct fetches and client side parcing to my blog

The aim for this is to have something like

<div css={background: red; font-size: 32px}>
  <img src="rooted-import.png" />
	<button onClick={}>
		test
	</button>
</div>

and parse it all in a way where it all loads after a fetch request from this github repository.
